Description: Power Management performance analysis
 This package is designed to assist kernel and OS developers in optimizing
 their linux stack's boot and suspend/resume time. It includes two tools:
 bootgraph and sleepgraph, which use dmesg and ftrace data to create
 timelines of kernel boot and suspend/resume respectively. The timelines
 provide a detailed view of which devices/subsystems are taking the most
 time in boot and suspend/resume.
