Subject: [PATCH v5 0/2] USB: resume time optimization by using spec minimums

The USB resume code in the kernel currently uses a set of hard coded
delay values that are defined in the USB 2.0 spec. These are the
most important ones:

 - tdrsmdn: resume signal time (20ms - infinity) usb 2.0 spec 7.1.7.7
 - trsmrcy: resume recovery time (10ms) usb 2.0 spec 7.1.7.7
 - trstrcy: reset recovery time (0ms - infinity) usb 2.0 spec 7.1.7.5
 - tdrstr: root port reset time (50ms) usb2.0 spec 7.1.7.5

Some of these values have been padded considerably in order to accomodate
non-compliant devices.

 - tdrsmdn: resume signal time = 40ms
 - trstrcy: reset recovery time = 50ms

I propose that we provide a kernel parameter that sets the USB timing
values to their spec minimums. The following patches do this by creating
a global struct which contains these values. By default the values remain
as they are now, but if usbcore.timing_minimum=1 is added to the kernel cmd
line they're set to their minimums. This struct can be expanded over time
to include other hardcoded values that have padding we can remove.

The patch is also useful in padding delay values even further for really
temperamental devices.

I've created a blog entry on 01.org with some analyze_suspend test
cases illustrating the benefits:
